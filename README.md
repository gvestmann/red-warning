# red-warning
School assignment on FETCH API

[LIVE SITE](https://gvestmann.github.io/red-warning/)

An app previously known as "Red Warning", RadWeather uses NASA's Mars Weather API to display info on life conditions on the Red Planet.

I tried doing all best-known practices (to me at least) when building the site. It uses SASS and it's designed and built mobile-first. It's plain HTML and has no library dependencies. Beside using NASA's API it also utilizes localStorage Web API. 

Since it's a JS assignment, the index.html and style.scss don't have any comments. They are both simple enough and well organized. The script.js has plenty of info tho!

Have a good trip!
